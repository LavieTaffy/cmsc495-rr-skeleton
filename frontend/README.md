---/* || About FRONTEND */---

- This skeleton was created using npx create-react-app
- I removed some of the initial clutter from folders generated from create-react-app

- This is a skeleton, if you wish to check out the frontend,
    1. Run npm start in the backend directory
    2. open your browser to http://localhost:3000
    3. Some tutorials might have React Router on the App.js file, or the index.js file
    4. To interact with both the UI/BACKEND at the SAME TIME, both need to be running, so you need to "npm start" both directories.

- .gitignore included for .env file and node_modules
